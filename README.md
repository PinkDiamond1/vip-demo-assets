# ProtonVIP Demo Assets

The following is a demo project similar to Tasky that can be built on Proton. It's a VIP chat room for a country singer.

Users can gain entry at 3 levels by paying with Stable Coin (XUSDT) or FooBar tokens (free tokens)

Once in the VIP room, the user enters a chat that is private to the user.

The user can re-enter the VIP area by logging in with Proton.

The chat needs to be functional, the ESR Proton requests must work as intended, and all mocks must be implemented.

$5,000 bounty to the first person/team who completes it.
The Metal and Proton teams will be judging the entries.
